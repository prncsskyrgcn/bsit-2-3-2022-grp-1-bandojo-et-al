    <p class="description">As you can see, it’s the song’s emotional content that you’re addressing, not the various events described in the song. A song can take the listener on a complex journey, but like the European trip, it all needs to be able to be expressed in a simple phrase that describes its very heart and purpose.

      <p>Music is no stranger to anyone, but have you ever asked someone as to what music is. If not, then try on but be prepared that you would not receive any definite answer from anyone. The dictionary defines music as ‘the art of arranging tones in an orderly sequence so as to produce a unified and continuous composition’. However, in the larger picture, the definition of music varies with culture, people, place or time. Music is sublime and too varied, leaving each individual with a different set of choice. For some music may be a source of relaxation, while for others it could be the means to let out their internal anguish. Even a person with the least inclination towards melody can recognize a piece of music instantly.</p>

      <h2><a href="#">With the diversity in the forms of music, here is a classification of some of the different types of music.</a></h2>
      <p class="date">Posted by <a href="#">Group 1</a> | <a href="#">May 04 2022</a></p>
      <p><img src="https://img0.etsystatic.com/135/0/5268504/il_570xN.916512468_ekce.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft"/></p>
      
      <p>Classical - Classical music is a very general term which normally refers to the standard music of countries in the western world. It is music that has been composed by musicians who are trained in the art of writing music and written down in music notation so that other musicians can play it. </p>

      <p>Rock - A type of pop music that developed out of rock‘n’roll in the 1960s and 1970s. It is based around amplified instruments, especially the electric guitar and electric bass, and is characterized by a strong bass line and driving rhythms. It is typically performed by rock groups, and while fast dance music is the staple form, slower ballad-style songs are also a popular part of the repertoire.</p>
        
        
      <p>Heavy Metal - Heavy metal, genre of rock music that includes a group of related styles that are intense, virtuosic, and powerful. Driven by the aggressive sounds of the distorted electric guitar, heavy metal is arguably the most commercially successful genre of rock music.</p>
        
        
      <p>Jazz - It is a kind of music in which improvisation is typically an important part. In most jazz performances, players play solos which they make up on the spot, which requires considerable skill. There is tremendous variety in jazz, but most jazz is very rhythmic, has a forward momentum called "swing," and uses "bent" or "blue" notes.</p>
        
        
      <p>Trance - Trance is a genre of electronic dance music that developed in the 1990s in Germany. It is characterized by a tempo of between 110 and 150 beats per minute, repeating melodic phrases, and a musical form that builds up and down throughout a track. Trance is a genre on its own, but also will include other styles of electronic music such as techno, house, pop, chill-out, classical music:16 and film music. Trance refers to an induced emotional feeling, high, euphoria, chills, and uplifting rush listeners experience.</p>
        
        
        
      <p>Hip-Hop - Hip hop music or hip-hop music, also known as rap music, is a genre of popular music developed in the United States by inner-city African Americans, Latino Americans and Caribbean Americans in the Bronx borough of New York City in the 1970s. It consists of a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted. It developed as part of hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching with turntables, break dancing, and graffiti writing. Other elements include sampling beats or bass lines from records (or synthesized beats and sounds), and rhythmic beatboxing. While often used to refer solely to rapping, "hip hop" more properly denotes the practice of the entire subculture</p>
        
        
        
      <p>Folk Music - is a type of traditional and generally rural music that originally was passed down through families and other small social groups. Typically, folk music, like folk literature, lives in oral tradition; it is learned through hearing rather than reading. It is functional in the sense that it is associated with other activities, and it is primarily rural in origin. The usefulness of the concept varies from culture to culture, but it is most convenient as a designation of a type of music of Europe and the Americas.</p>
        
        
        
        
      <p>Techno - Techno is a genre of electronic dance music (EDM) commonly characterized by a repetitive four on the floor beat which is generally produced for use in a continuous DJ set. The central rhythm is often in common time, while the tempo typically varies between 120 and 150 beats per minute (bpm). Artists may use electronic instruments such as drum machines, sequencers, and synthesizers, as well as digital audio workstations.</p>
