# üé∂ DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC üé∂

Music is no stranger to anyone, but have you ever asked someone as to what music is. If not, then try on but be prepared that you would not receive any definite answer from anyone. The dictionary defines music as ‚Äòthe art of arranging tones in an orderly sequence so as to produce a unified and continuous composition‚Äô. However, in the larger picture, the definition of music varies with culture, people, place or time. Music is sublime and too varied, leaving each individual with a different set of choice. For some music may be a source of relaxation, while for others it could be the means to let out their internal anguish. Even a person with the least inclination towards melody can recognize a piece of music instantly.  With the diversity in the forms of music, here is a classification of some of the different types of music.
